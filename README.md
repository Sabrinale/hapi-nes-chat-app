# hapi-nes-chat-app
This is the source code for a sample chat app using [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) and the new hapi websocket adapter: [nes](https://github.com/hapijs/nes). 

This is an open sample, all questions no matter how basic welcome and encouraged. If you would like to see this project cover a specific area e.g. views, caching, different auth schemes, open an issue and I will try cover it. 

You can catch me on twitter either if you have questions: [@johnbrett_](https://www.twitter.com/johnbrett_).

Thanks to the [socket.io chat sample app](https://github.com/rauchg/chat-example) for inspiration.
